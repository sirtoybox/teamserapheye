          <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
          <p>Some common questions and answers regarding this project. If you have any questions, feel free to send a message to our chatbox or into our email inbox, and we will try to respond as quickly as possible!</p>
          <h2>"Who are these people?"</h2>
          <p>Currently, the majority of featured creators are friends of ours, who all have their own creative projects and endeavors. We may expand to a wider array of creators in the future, but for now we are simply hosting whoever we know personally.</p>
          <h2>"Can I become an affiliate?"</h2>
          <p>If you are friends with any of us or our affiliates, feel free to contact our Webmaster about it (or getting a friend who is an affiliate to send us a message!)</p>
          <p>If you are an acquaintance and/or not really connected to any of us in any way, we may not be willing to accept any requests to join if we aren't at least familiar with you. This is mostly just for safety reasons. In the future we may become more open to taking applications and such to join, but since this project is in its infancy we will remain relatively closed.</p>
          <h2>"What are your goals for this website?"</h2>
          <p>This website intends to host and provide opportunities for our affiliates, in addition to having a network to contact each of us. We do not own the projects sponsored on this page, nor do we ever intend on trying to own any portion of them. This network helps as a way for you to easily engage with us for anything you may be interested in!</p>
